V1.0 10-02-2014   

First release

V1.1 28-02-2014   

New features:	  
* Batch mode functionality to allow kubeviz to work automatically. Requires 
  the redshift keyword to be set. Works in combination with /fit_all_lines  
  to specify whether to fit only the mainline or the narrow components of   
  all lines in the selected lineset. 
* Load session from the command line. If the first keyword has extension     
  ".sav" it is assumed to be a kubeviz saved session. 
* Load a result file into a new session. If the resfile keyword is set, a   
  result file is loaded into a new session. 
* Add MonteCarlo 3 method for error estimate. Works with the smoothed 
  datacube but the amplitude of random noise added to the spectra is 
  obtained from then residuals from a first fit instead of from  the noise 
  cube. The residuals are also randomly shifted along the wavelength axis.  
* Add display header option in the File drop-down menu.  
* Add Optimal Mask option in the Spaxel Mask drop-down menu. The mask is 
  drawn from spaxels with S/N > 5 in the currently displayed image.
* Add the FIT ADJ button to fit bad spaxels using initial guess from adjacent
  spaxels with OK flag. Automatically iterates until no more success. 
* In the Help menu an (incomplete) instruction document is now available.
* Weighted Avg and Weighted Med options available in the image mode menu.
* Optimal option available in the spectrum mode menu.

Improvements and bug fixes:
* Fixed a bug that produced an unallocated variable error when attempting 
  to fit a line without continuum using one of the montecarlo error methods.
* Improved memory allocation. The program now uses less memory when the 
  montecarlo error methods are called. A better garbage collector makes 
  sure that all pointers are destroyed upon the Quit call. 
* The fitting range is now defined w.r.t. the bisector of the two central 
  lines for linesets having an even number of lines. 
* Improved stability when fitting linesets other than 1. 
* Changing the redshift no longer makes the linefit window freeze. The 
  buttons status was not correctly propagated.
* The header of the results file carries more details on the parameters that
  were set in the kubeviz session. Results from versions before V1.1 cannot 
  be loaded using the resfile keyword. 
* The wavelength solution keywords are now written in the header when a 1D
  spectrum is saved.  
* The height of the linefit window is automatically adjusted according to 
  the number of lines to be fit. The width has been reduced for better 
  rendering on low-resolution displays. 
* The Sum, Median, etc. images are now updated every time the wavelength
  range is changed.
* The bad-spaxels are shown in white in the spaxel viewer (as in Ds9) and 
  their values are correctly printed as NaN. 
* The first and the last 100 lambda pixels are not taken into account when 
  computing the y-range for the spectrum viewer. 

V1.2 26-03-2014   

New features:
* Moments can be now computed. The integrated flux, first and second moments
  are shown in the graphical window. Higher order moments (skewness and kurtosis)
  are stored and output only in the results FITS file.
* When a montecarlo error method is called, the noise cube is correctly computed 
  from the montecarlo cubes. This feature can be switched on/off in the option 
  menu. The default is off.

Improvements and bug fixes:
* Redesigned linefit window, now also allows the autoflag parameters to be 
  altered, as well as the flux threshold for the moments.
* The smooth parameters can be interactively changed using the dedicated 
  dialog window selected in the options menu.  
* The IDL path is searched for all the necessary routines before kubeviz 
  can start.
* The environmental variable KUBEVIZ_DEFAULT is not required if all the add-on
  files are in the same directory of the main kubeviz.pro file.  
* The dir keyword has been removed. The datacube path can be specified with the
  file name. The bootstrap cubes are searched in the same path if no explicit
  path is given. The results file is searched in the current working directory
  if the path is not given. The path can either be relative to the working dir 
  or absolute.
* The image saved with the Print command is rebinned to higher resolution.     
* Now works also if the WCS keywords are missing in the header.
* The widget IDs are no longer stored in the saved session.
* Various performance and memory usage improvements.	

V1.3 31-10-2014   

New features:
* Line ratios for OI, OII and NII lines can be fixed ion the fit via the
  linefit window dedicated button.
* The instrumental resolution routines have been rewritten from the ground-up 
  and the code is now instrument sensitive. For all the instruments the resultion 
  can be computed from the noisecube lines.
  For KMOS the polynomial fit coefficients are searched in the datafile header or
  sourced from general resolution curves stored in the kubeviz release.
* The trim keyword can be set to read only a portion of the datacube. See the 
  instructions for the details of the syntax. Useful when dealing with large cubes. 

Improvements and bug fixes:
* Redesigned directory structure for the code. Now includes subdirectories for
  the templates, additional routines used and the documentation.
* The fname keyword is now called with datafile and is mandatory. If the 
  file is a saved session the session is restored. If the noisecube is saved
  in a separate file it can be input using the noisefile keyword or can be 
  interactively selected via a pop-up window.
* For cryogenic instruments working in vacuum (currently KMOS and SINFONI) the
  lines database is converted to vacuum wavelengths.
* Redesigned info section in the spaxel viewer, now includes the Image and Physical
  coordinates (like in ds9) to avoid confusion when the trim keyword is set.
* The zcut menu now includes more options including a pop-up window where the 
  spaxel values distribution is plotted and that allows interactive adjustment of the
  user min and max color cuts. The spaxel user limits are now independent from the 
  spectral scale limits. 
* Several improvements to make the code efficient on large IFU (like SINFONI) and
  reduce the memory usage. In case of long procedures, a progress line is printed
  on the terminal as well with an estimate of the residual time to the end.
* Fixed the 1D spectrum save procedure and a save cube feature is now also available.        
* The batch mode works on spaxel masks now as well as on spaxels.  

V1.3.1 - 1.3.3

Improvements and bug fixes:
* Masks are now handeld in 2D instead of 1D internally. This means saved masks 
  can be used by other programs.
* Lineset 8 added. It includes Lya.
* Addon routines are now kubeviz specific (they are called kubeviz_routinename). 
  This solves conflicts with other routines with the same name in IDL path.
* If a routine is missing the code prints warnings but continues to work. The user
  should check if the missing routine is important for kubeviz (Astrolib or Coyote 
  might be missing).  
* The code automatically checks if MPFIT version is more recent than 1.70. 
  Otherwise it stops with an error.  

V1.4 24-11-2015

New features:
* Save the currently displayed image and associated noise. Useful if you want to
  save a narrow band image or one single plane of the linefit results structure.
  
Improvements and bug fixes:
* Revised and updated documentation
* The code now checks extensively (at startup) for the presence of 3-rd party 
  libraries and if they are up-to-date. Errors are printed otherwise.
* Revised and improved spectral viewer title bar. Now shows the currently selected 
  range (1 or 2).
* Display FITS header now allows the user to select the primary, data or noise header.
  If the file does not have a primary header this option is not present.  

V1.4.1 16-12-2015 

Improvements and bug fixes:
* Critical bug fix preventing the results to be saved if lineset=0
* Improved intial guess on the line position.

V2.0 12-06-2016

This version presents so many new features that we dare calling it V2.0!

New features:
* Zoom in and out in the spaxel viewer with the zoom button and navigate by clicking 
  near the edges of the viewer. Particularly useful for large datacubes.
* Circular and square spaxel masks of a given size can now be conventiently defined
  using the new pop-up window Mask parameters (in Sp.Masks)
* Improvements on the handling of a second gaussian component in the fits. The user
  can define if the second component needs to have a larger sigma or a larger velocity
  w.r.t. the first component. If the fit is left free the second component will be the 
  fainter.
* The range of spaxels for FIT ALL and FITADJ ALL can be specified by the user. Go to 
  Options --> FITALL range and specify your limits. You can also revert to the default
  limits (fit the entire cube). 
* (BETA) User initial guess maps (gaussian) and window parameter maps (moments) can be 
  loaded. However be aware that this is not fully implemented yet and can only be done
  from the command line when kubeviz is called. A forthcoming release will allow full
  interactivity on those maps.
* Very long fitting runs can be now interrupted at any time thanks to the Interrupt Fit
  window that automatically appears if you click FITALL or FITADJ ALL.  
  
Improvements and bug fixes:
* NaNs in the datacube are now natively handeld by the code (no need to convert them to
  zeroes internally). 
* Significant performance updates for FITALL, bad spaxels are skipped and the overall 
  runtime has been improved by a factor ~ 2. 
* Improvements in the initial guess values for lines different from the mainline.
* The definition of line flux S/N for flagging purposes is set relative to the 
  NEGATIVE 1-sigma error only. TODO: Should consistently set S/N computed for viewing.
* Fix problem with spikes in continuum fitting region driving a poor fit: only fit 
  wavelength channels with spectrum and noise within well controlled rang
* Fix  a rare bug that unmasked image was not shown when unflagged results cube 
  is selected, if all spaxels are flagged.
* Allow cursor and spaxel mask to be displayed simultaneously, and adjust colour 
  of cursor to accomodate this 
* Spaxel masks feature extra diagonal line to identify selected spaxels unambiguously.
* Several minor bug fixes (the instr keyword set from the command line is now honored 
  by the code)
    
V2.1 ??-11-2017

New features:
* New Smart option for the fitting of second components. This applies only when there are
  two separate narrow kinematical components (not for narrow+broad coincident lines). If
  the flag is set the code attempts to automatically decide whether two components are
  indeed present (following the criteria defined in Consolandi et al. 2017, A&A, 606, 83).
  If these criteria are not satisfied, only one component is fit and saved. (Use with
  caution)

Improvements and bug fixes:
* The iterative fitadjall now uses a completely new iteration scheme that loops over spaxels
  with the highest number of valid nearby fits and then iterates until no more improvements
  are possible.
* Several minor bug fixes
